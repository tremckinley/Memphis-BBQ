You are an expert AI assistant specializing in government procurement. Your purpose is to read, analyze, and deconstruct complex Request for Proposal (RFP) and Request for Qualification (RFQ) documents. You will be provided with the full text of an RFQ/RFP.

Your task is to act as a "Small Business services professional," as defined in the original user prompt. You will analyze the document and extract specific, actionable information for a small business owner.

Your output must be a single, structured JSON object. Do not provide any conversational text or summaries outside of this JSON structure.

Core Directives:
Audience: The end-user is a small business owner. All extracted descriptions, instructions, and summaries must be in simple, common language at a sixth-grade reading level.

Scope: Focus only on information relevant to qualifying and submitting a bid. Ignore any information that is only relevant after the contract is won (e.g., specific invoicing procedures, post-award contract management, penalties for non-performance), unless it is a "Good to Know" caveat. Any caveats should be listed in one portion of the JSON.

Citation is Mandatory: Every piece of information you extract MUST be traceable to its source. Always provide the page number and, if possible, the section or exhibit name (e.g., "Page 15", "Section 2.2, Item 9", "Exhibit F").

Conciseness: Cut out all redundant or overly verbose "legalese" and "bureaucratese."

Templatize: Adhere strictly to the JSON schema defined below. If a section is not present in the document, return an empty array [] or a null value for that key.

JSON Output Schema:

  "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",

    // If confidence is 'low' or 'medium', add flags here.

Page | 24
The Initial Term of this Agreement shall commence beginning [@CONTRACT BEGIN
DATE@] and shall end on the earlier of [@CONTRACT END DATE@] or until all
goods/services herein have been provided to City ("Initial Term"), subject to the
availability and appropriation of funds to finance the same and the successful operation

City shall have the option to extend the Initial Term for [@NO. OF OPTION PERIODS@]
additional [@LENGTH OF OPTION PERIOD@] period(s) (the "Option Periods"), subject to
the appropriation of funds by the Memphis City Council and mutual agreement of the
parties, evidenced in writing. The Initial Term and the exercised Option Periods are
collectively referred to hereinafter as the "Term."
Eligible costs authorized by City and incurred after the Initial Term begins, but prior to the
execution of this Agreement, shall be paid under this Agreement.
INVOICES. Contractor shall submit original invoices, or copies of original invoices certified
as such by Contractor, on Contractor's letterhead and in form and substance acceptable
by City and with all necessary supporting documentation, to City. Contractor shall invoice
in duplicate, if requested. The invoice shall describe the goods (the items sold) or services
provided, list the price per unit, reflect any applicable terms of payment, and show the

due to Contractor under this Agreement or any other agreement.

expenditures and revenue collections, related to this Agreement, are NOT carried

ASSIGNMENT, SUBCONTRACTING, or TRANSFER. Contractor shall not subcontract,
assign, delegate or transfer all or part of its rights, responsibilities, or interest under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of City. Any purported assignment, transfer,
or delegation in violation of this Section shall be voidable by City. No subcontracting,
assignment, delegation or transfer shall relieve Contractor from performance of its duties
hereunder; neither shall City be responsible for the fulfillment of Contractor's obligations
to its transferors or subcontractors. Upon request of City, the subcontracting, assigning,
delegating or transferring party shall provide all documents evidencing the transfer. At
any time, City may, in its sole discretion, revoke its prior approval of a subcontractor and
direct Contractor to replace such subcontractor or perform the services that were being
performed by such Contractor itself if City finds in its reasonable judgment that (i) such
subcontractor's performance is materially deficient or otherwise unacceptable to City; (ii)
good faith doubts exist concerning the subcontractor's ability to render future
performance because of changes in the subcontractor's ownership, management,
financial condition, or otherwise; or (iii) there have been one (1) or more material
misrepresentations by or concerning the subcontractor. City reserves the right to
terminate the Agreement if Contractor, in whole or in part, is acquired by another entity
during the term of this Agreement. In the event Contractor is allowed to sublet any part
of the Agreement, Contractor shall be as fully responsible to City for the acts and
omissions of the subcontractor and the subcontractor’s employees, as Contractor is
responsible for the acts and omissions of Contractor’s own employees.
ASSIGNS. See SUCCESSORS.
AUDITS. See RECORDS.
BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL. In connection with Tennessee Code Annotated Section 12-4-119,
Contractor certifies that it is not currently engaged in nor will it engage in a boycott of
Israel. For this purpose, a “boycott of Israel” shall mean engaging in refusals to deal,
terminating business activities, or other commercial actions that are intended to limit
commercial relations with Israel, or companies doing business in or with Israel or
authorized by, licensed by, or organized under the laws of the State of Israel to do
business, or persons or entities doing business in Israel, when such actions are taken (i) in
compliance with, or adherence to, calls for a boycott of Israel, or (ii) in a manner that
discriminates on the basis of nationality, national origin, religion, or other unreasonable
basis, and is not based on a valid business reason. This provision is not applicable to
contracts with a value less than $250,000 or to companies with less than 10 employees.
CITY FACILITIES. Except to the extent otherwise approved by City in its sole discretion,
Contractor shall use any and all items provided by City for the sole and exclusive purpose
of providing the services or for delivery of goods described in this Agreement. Use of City
facilities by Contractor does not constitute a leasehold interest in favor of Contractor or
Contractor's customers.

-- 26 of 56 --

Page | 27
Contractor shall use any and all items provided by City in an efficient manner. To the
extent that Contractor utilizes such items provided by City in any manner that
unnecessarily increases facility costs or other costs incurred by City, City reserves the right
to set-off the excess costs of such practices. Contractor shall be responsible for any
damage to any and all item(s) provided by City resulting from the abuse, misuse, or
neglect of Contractor, its employees and subcontractors or other failure to comply with
its obligations respecting such items provided by City.
Contractor, its employees and agents shall keep any and all items provided by City in good
order, not commit or permit waste or damage to such items, and not use such items for
any unlawful purpose. Contractor shall act and comply with City's standard policies and
procedures as made available to Contractor regarding access to and use of such City-
provided items, including procedures for the physical security of City facilities.
Contractor shall permit City and its agents and representatives to enter into those
portions of City facilities occupied by Contractor staff at any time to perform facilities-
related services.
Contractor shall not make any improvements or changes involving structural, mechanical
or electrical alterations to City facilities without City's prior written approval. Any
improvements to City facilities will become the property of City.
When City facilities are no longer required for performance of the services described in
Exhibit “[@EXHIBIT IDENTIFICATION@]”, Contractor shall return such facilities to City in
substantially the same condition as when Contractor began use of such facilities, subject
to reasonable wear and tear.
CITY LIABILITY. City shall have no liability except as specifically provided in this
Agreement. City, by execution of this Agreement, assumes no liability for damages caused
to persons or property by reason of Contractor providing goods or services herein or for
injury to any employee, agent or subcontractor of the Contractor performing under this
Agreement.
CITY'S RIGHT TO WITHHOLD CERTAIN AMOUNTS AND MAKE APPLICATION THEREOF. If
evidence is produced before the final settlement of all or any balances that Contractor
has failed to pay subcontractors, laborers employed on its work, or failed to pay for
materials used therein, or if City has reason to suspect the same, City may withhold such
balances and upon evidence satisfactory to City as to the amount due for such goods,
labor, and materials, City, acting as the agent of Contractor, may settle and pay for the
same and charge the amounts to Contractor and deduct the same from the said balance
or balances.
COMPANY’S/CONTRACTOR'S PERSONNEL. (This paragraph/section is applicable only to
purchase of services contracts). Contractor certifies that it presently has adequate

-- 27 of 56 --

Page | 28
qualified personnel to perform all services required under this Agreement and that all
services performed under this Agreement shall be supervised by Contractor. Contractor
will make its personnel aware of and cause them to comply with City's policies that have
been made known to Contractor while performing pursuant to this
Agreement. Contractor further certifies that all of its employees assigned to perform any
services hereunder shall have such knowledge and experience as required to perform the
duties assigned to them. Any employee of Contractor who, in the opinion of City, is
incompetent, whose conduct becomes detrimental to the services, or whom City deems
to be unsatisfactory for any reason, shall immediately be removed from association with
the services hereunder per City's request. Upon such request, Contractor shall use all
reasonable efforts to promptly replace such employee(s) with substitute employee(s)
having appropriate skills and training. Contractor is responsible for the acts or omissions
of its personnel under or relating to this Agreement.
Contractor shall be solely liable and responsible for providing all employee compensation
and benefits to, or on behalf of, all persons performing services pursuant to this
Agreement. City shall have no liability or responsibility for the payment of any salaries,
wages, unemployment benefits, health, welfare and disability benefits, federal and local
taxes, or other compensation, benefits or taxes for any personnel provided on behalf of
Contractor. In addition, Contractor shall be solely liable and responsible for any and all
workers' compensation benefits to any person as a result of injuries arising from or
connected with any services performed by or on behalf of Contractor pursuant to this
Agreement.
CONFIDENTIALITY. Subject to the open records laws of the State of Tennessee, while
performing under this Agreement, the parties may gain access to proprietary and/or
confidential information that, if disclosed to third parties, may be damaging to each other.
The parties agree not to disclose such information to third parties and shall take all
reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access to any of each other’s confidential and
proprietary information. Such information shall include, but shall not be limited to,
materials considered to be confidential information as a matter of law (e.g., personnel
records), and shall also include (i) all materials in any form developed or created by each

possessed or used by a party, which is communicated to, learned, developed or otherwise
acquired by that party in the performance of this Agreement; (iii) the terms, conditions

party is confidential, privileged or proprietary. Confidential information, as used in this
Agreement, shall not include (i) information in a party’s possession prior to disclosure; (ii)
information generally available to the public or that becomes available to the public
through a source other than a party under this Agreement, or (iii) information that was
rightfully obtained by a party from a third party who is under no obligation of

other in confidence at all times during and after termination of this Agreement. A party

-- 28 of 56 --

Page | 29
shall neither use nor disclose such information, except as provided in this Agreement or
as required by law, without the prior written permission of affected party.
Subject to the open record laws of the State of Tennessee, each party acknowledges and
agrees that a breach of this section may cause the affected party irreparable injury and
damage; therefore, each party expressly agrees that the affected party shall be entitled
to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to
prevent or otherwise restrain a breach of this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will
disclose confidential information only to those employees who have a right and need to
know, and shall require its employees, agents, and subcontractors to comply with the
requirements of this provision and the requirements of the provisions herein titled "Public
Statements" and "Rights in Data."
CONFLICT OF INTEREST. Neither party shall engage in any conduct or activity in the
performance of this Agreement that constitutes a conflict of interest under applicable
federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations. Contractor covenants that it has no
public or private interest, and shall not acquire any interest, directly or indirectly, which
would conflict in any manner with the performance required under this Agreement, and
Contractor covenants that no gratuities, in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise,
were offered or given by Contractor or any agent or representative of Contractor, to any
officer, official, agent or employee of City, in an effort to secure the Agreement or
favorable treatment with respect to any determinations concerning the performance of
the Agreement. Contractor warrants that no part of the total contract amount provided
herein shall be paid directly or indirectly to any officer or employee of City as wages,
compensation, or gifts in exchange for acting as officer, agent, employee, subcontractor
or consultant to Contractor in connection with anything contemplated or performed
relative to this Agreement. For breach or violation of this provision, City shall have the
right to recover or withhold the full amount of such gratuities.

any company or person, other than a bona fide employee working solely for Contractor
any fee, commission, percentage, brokerage fee, gift, or any other consideration
contingent upon or resulting from the award or making of this Agreement. For breach or
