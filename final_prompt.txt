You are an expert AI assistant specializing in government procurement. Your purpose is to read, analyze, and deconstruct complex Request for Proposal (RFP) and Request for Qualification (RFQ) documents. You will be provided with the full text of an RFQ/RFP.

Your task is to act as a "Small Business services professional," as defined in the original user prompt. You will analyze the document and extract specific, actionable information for a small business owner.

Your output must be a single, structured JSON object. Do not provide any conversational text or summaries outside of this JSON structure.

Core Directives:
Audience: The end-user is a small business owner. All extracted descriptions, instructions, and summaries must be in simple, common language at a sixth-grade reading level.

Scope: Focus only on information relevant to qualifying and submitting a bid. Ignore any information that is only relevant after the contract is won (e.g., specific invoicing procedures, post-award contract management, penalties for non-performance), unless it is a "Good to Know" caveat. Any caveats should be listed in one portion of the JSON.

Citation is Mandatory: Every piece of information you extract MUST be traceable to its source. Always provide the page number and, if possible, the section or exhibit name (e.g., "Page 15", "Section 2.2, Item 9", "Exhibit F").

Conciseness: Cut out all redundant or overly verbose "legalese" and "bureaucratese."

Templatize: Adhere strictly to the JSON schema defined below. If a section is not present in the document, return an empty array [] or a null value for that key. Find the bid's due date and classify it as "bid due date" if possible.

JSON Output Schema:

    // If confidence is 'low' or 'medium', add flags here.

RFQ CONTRACT EXAMPLE
The successful Contractor will be required to comply with and execute an agreement specifying the
following general terms and conditions, as may be modified and/or supplemented at the City's sole
discretion:
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be modified or amended only by a written amendment executed by
all parties hereto and approved by the appropriate City officials in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations.
ASSIGNMENT, SUBCONTRACTING, or TRANSFER. Contractor shall not subcontract, assign,
delegate or transfer all or part of its rights, responsibilities, or interest under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the City. Any purported assignment, transfer, or delegation in violation of this
Section shall be voidable by the City. No subcontracting, assignment, delegation or transfer shall relieve
Contractor from performance of its duties hereunder; neither shall the City be responsible for the
fulfillment of Contractor's obligations to its transferors or subcontractors. Upon request of the City, the
subcontracting, assigning, delegating or transferring party shall provide all documents evidencing the
transfer. At any time, City may, in its sole discretion, revoke its prior approval of a subcontractor and direct
Contractor to replace such subcontractor or perform the services that were being performed by such
Contractor itself if the City finds in its reasonable judgment that (i) such subcontractor's performance is
materially deficient or otherwise unacceptable to City; (ii) good faith doubts exist concerning the
subcontractor's ability to render future performance because of changes in the subcontractor's ownership,
management, financial condition, or otherwise; or (iii) there have been one (1) or more material
misrepresentations by or concerning the subcontractor. The City reserves the right to terminate the
Agreement if Contractor, in whole or in part, is acquired by another entity during the term of this
Agreement. In the event Contractor is allowed to sublet any part of the Agreement, Contractor shall be as
fully responsible to the City for the acts and omissions of the subcontractor and the subcontractor's
employees, as Contractor is responsible for the acts and omissions of Contractor's own employees.
ASSIGNS. See SUCCESSORS.
AUDITS. See RECORDS.
CITY FACILITIES. Except to the extent otherwise approved by the City in its sole discretion, Contractor
shall use any and all items provided by the City for the sole and exclusive purpose of providing the services
or for delivery of goods described in this Agreement. Use of City facilities by Contractor does not
constitute a leasehold interest in favor of Contractor or Contractor's customers.
Contractor shall use any and all items provided by the City in an efficient manner. To the extent that
Contractor utilizes such items provided by the City in any manner that unnecessarily increases facility costs
or other costs incurred by the City, City reserves the right to set-off the excess costs of such practices.
Contractor shall be responsible for any damage to any and all item(s) provided by the City resulting from
the abuse, misuse, or neglect of Contractor, its employees and subcontractors or other failure to comply
with its obligations respecting such items provided by the City.
Contractor, its employees and agents shall keep any and all items provided by the City in good order, not

commit or permit waste or damage to such items, and not use such items for any unlawful purpose.
Contractor shall act and comply with City's standard policies and procedures as made available to
Contractor regarding access to and use of such City-provided items, including procedures for the physical
security of the City facilities.
Contractor shall permit City and its agents and representatives to enter into those portions of the City
facilities occupied by Contractor staff at any time to perform facilities-related services.
Contractor shall not make any improvements or changes involving structural, mechanical or electrical
alterations to the City facilities without the City's prior written approval. Any improvements to the City
facilities will become the property of the City.
When the City facilities are no longer required for performance of the services described in Exhibit "[
@EXHIBIT IDENTIFICATION@ ]", Contractor shall return such facilities to the City in substantially the
same condition as when Contractor began use of such facilities, subject to reasonable wear and tear.
CITY LIABILITY. The City shall have no liability except as specifically provided in this Agreement. The
City, by execution of this Agreement, assumes no liability for damages caused to persons or property by
reason of Contractor providing goods or services herein or for injury to any employee, agent or
subcontractor of the Contractor performing under this Agreement.
CITY'S RIGHT TO WITHHOLD CERTAIN AMOUNTS AND MAKE APPLICATION
THEREOF. If evidence is produced before the final settlement of all or any balances that Contractor has
failed to pay subcontractors, laborers employed on its work, or failed to pay for materials used therein, or if
the City has reason to suspect the same, the City may withhold such balances and upon evidence
satisfactory to the City as to the amount due for such goods, labor, and materials, the City, acting as the
agent of Contractor, may settle and pay for the same and charge the amounts to Contractor and deduct the
same from the said balance or balances.
COMPANY'S/CONTRACTOR'S PERSONNEL. (This paragraph/section is applicable only to
purchase of services contracts). Contractor certifies that it presently has adequate qualified personnel to
perform all services required under this Agreement and that all services performed under this Agreement
shall be supervised by Contractor. Contractor will make its personnel aware of and cause them to comply
with the City's policies that have been made known to Contractor while performing pursuant to this
Agreement. Contractor further certifies that all of its employees assigned to perform any services hereunder
shall have such knowledge and experience as required to perform the duties assigned to them. Any
employee of Contractor who, in the opinion of the City, is incompetent, whose conduct becomes
detrimental to the services, or whom the City deems to be unsatisfactory for any reason, shall immediately
be removed from association with the services hereunder per the City's request. Upon such request,
Contractor shall use all reasonable efforts to promptly replace such employee(s) with substitute
employee(s) having appropriate skills and training. Contractor is responsible for the acts or omissions of its
personnel under or relating to this Agreement.
Contractor shall be solely liable and responsible for providing all employee compensation and benefits to,
or on behalf of, all persons performing services pursuant to this Agreement. The City shall have no liability
or responsibility for the payment of any salaries, wages, unemployment benefits, health, welfare and
disability benefits, federal and local taxes, or other compensation, benefits or taxes for any personnel
provided on behalf of Contractor. In addition, Contractor shall be solely liable and responsible for any and
all workers' compensation benefits to any person as a result of injuries arising from or connected with any
services performed by or on behalf of Contractor pursuant to this Agreement.
CONFIDENTIALITY. Subject to the open records laws of the State of Tennessee, while performing
under this Agreement, the parties may gain access to proprietary and/or confidential information that, if
disclosed to third parties, may be damaging to each other. The parties agree not to disclose such
information to third parties and shall take all reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access to any of each

not include (i) information in a party's possession prior to disclosure; (ii) information generally available to
the public or that becomes available to the public through a source other than a party under this agreement,
or (iii) information that was rightfully obtained by a party from a third party who is under no obligation of
confidentiality to either party to this Agreement with respect to such information. Each party agrees that it
will accept and hold confidential information obtained from each other in confidence at all times during
and after termination of this Agreement. A party shall neither use nor disclose such information, except as
provided in this Agreement or as required by law, without the prior written permission of affected party.
Subject to the open record laws of the State of Tennessee, each party acknowledges and agrees that a
breach of this section may cause the affected party irreparable injury and damage; therefore, each party
expressly agrees that the affected party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any
court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or otherwise restrain a breach of this Agreement. Each party
agrees that it will disclose confidential information only to those employees who have a right and need to
know, and shall require its employees, agents, and subcontractors to comply with the requirements of this
provision and the requirements of the provisions herein titled "Public Statements" and "Rights in Data."
CONFLICT OF INTEREST. Neither party shall engage in any conduct or activity in the performance of
this Agreement that constitutes a conflict of interest under applicable federal, state or local laws, rules and
regulations. Contractor covenants that it has no public or private interest, and shall not acquire any interest,
directly or indirectly, which would conflict in any manner with the performance required under this
Agreement, and Contractor covenants that no gratuities, in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise,
were offered or given by Contractor or any agent or representative of Contractor, to any officer, official,
agent or employee of the City, in an effort to secure the Agreement or favorable treatment with respect to
any determinations concerning the performance of the Agreement. Contractor warrants that no part of the
total contract amount provided herein shall be paid directly or indirectly to any officer or employee of the
City as wages, compensation, or gifts in exchange for acting as officer, agent, employee, subcontractor or
consultant to Contractor in connection with anything contemplated or performed relative to this
Agreement. For breach or violation of this provision, the City shall have the right to recover or withhold the
full amount of such gratuities.
COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be signed in multiple counterparts and/or counterpart signature
pages, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which when taken together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.
COVENANT AGAINST CONTINGENT FEES. Contractor warrants that it has not employed or
retained any company or person other than a bona fide employee working solely for Contractor, to solicit or
secure this Agreement, and that it has not paid or agreed to pay any company or person, other than a bona
fide employee working solely for Contractor any fee, commission, percentage, brokerage fee, gift, or any
other consideration contingent upon or resulting from the award or making of this Agreement. For breach
or violation of this provision/warranty, the City shall have the right to recover the full amount of such fee,
commission, percentage, brokerage fee, gift, or other consideration.

this Agreement, upon good-faith negotiation by the parties, a provision as similar in terms to such unlawful,
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible, and still be legal, valid and enforceable. Parties
acknowledge that some Agreement provisions may be inapplicable to the scope of work or goods that are
germane to this Agreement. Parties waive no rights or remedies where the provisions are applicable.
